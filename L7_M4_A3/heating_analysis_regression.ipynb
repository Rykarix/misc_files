That study investigated the effect of eight input variables (relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, glazing area distribution) on the required heating load.\n","\n","This study simulated a total of 768 buildings. Those buildings had different surface areas and dimensions, but the same volume and construction materials.\n","\n","The goal of this assignment is to use machine learning techniques for the prediction of the required heating load. Since the output variable of this dataset (required heating load) is a continuous variable, we will treat this problem as \n","\n","## About the assignment\n","\n","A typical supervised learning task involves creating training and testing sets, performing hyperparameter tuning on the selected algorithm and validating its performance. \n","\n","A preliminary study was applied to handle this problem. The selected algorithm was *K-Nearest Neighbours* (KNN). The performance of the method was validated on the testing data by capturing two different metrics: *Mean Absolute Error* (MAE) and *Mean Square Error* (MSE). The findings of this study were:\n","\n","**MAE = 1.875**\\\n","**MSE = 8.495**\n","\n","Let’s see if we can do better than that! For this assignment, we will go through the data first and check if we can apply feature engineering. Feature engineering is an important step as it can be used to create or remove features, reduce data complexity and generally understand the data better in order to improve performance. \n","\n","We will go through the steps of applying feature engineering, splitting the data into training/testing sets and using *k-fold* cross-validation to tune the parameters of KNN.

Analysis for feature engineering**\n","\n","In this part, we will investigate how we can manipulate the dataset in order to create/remove/manipulate features and extract useful information from the data. Your task for this part of the assignment is to do just that! \n","\n","Manipulate the data and come up with a new representation with the goal of improving performance. You can follow the hints that have been provided in this notebook as a guide.\n","\n","It is important to note that following all of the hints **does not** guarantee improved model performance. The hints are some standard methodologies that can be used for feature engineering. \n","\n","**It is up to you to implement the analysis you want in order to manipulate the datasets and improve the results at the end.**\n","\n","At the end of your analysis, replace the original DataFrames `X_train` and `X_eval`. Please ensure that these variables both are `pd.DataFrame()` Make sure you keep the same variable names, as it is important for the next steps of this assignment.\n","\n","Put all your processing within a function (e.g. `feature_engineering()`) instead of plain Python code.\n","\n","#### Hint No. 1 \n","\n","It is always useful to look at some basic information about the data we are dealing with. Since we are using `pandas`, we can apply the existing methods of the DataFrame `X_train` to check basic information about our dataset. Use the `.info()` and `.describe()` methods.\n","\n","#### Hint No. 2 \n","\n","It is helpful to create histograms of the examined variables. You can use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create those histograms and look at the distribution of the data. Depending on the distribution, we can apply various transformations.\n","\n","#### Hint No .3 \n","\n","Looking at the correlation values between the features, is a good way of determining which variables could be omitted. You can calculate and visualise the correlation matrix and decide which variables (if any) could be removed/replaced. \n","\n","The correlation matrix can be easily computed using the `.corr()` method of the `X_train` DataFrame.\n","\n","Visualising the matrix can be achieved with the `seaborn` library.\n","\n","#### Hint No. 4 \n","\n","It is important to look at the data and discover outliers (if any). Outliers can cause a model to underperform since they differ from the majority of the data. \n","\n","Visualising the data is a good method to detect outliers. However, there are some statistical methodologies that perform well and are quick to compute. Using standard deviation and the *z-score* is one such method.\n","\n","The *z-score* tells us how many standard deviations away a value is from the mean. If a sample is a certain number of standard deviations away from the mean (e.g. 2-4), then it can be assumed to be an outlier.\n","\n","Experiment with the data and determine whether some values could be treated as outliers.\n","\n","#### Hint No. 5 \n","\n","Some features in the dataset do not have continuous values. Instead they have integer values. In many cases, when a feature has only integer values, then it is possible that those values do not have a numerical meaning. \n","\n","Consider an example where there is a feature that describes the seasons ('autumn','winter','spring','summer') by using numbers 1,2,3,4. Even though 2>1 from a numerical standpoint, it makes no sense to say that 'winter'>'autumn'. This trick is useful when we do not want to work with categorical values.\n","\n","To handle situations similar to that one, we can use One-Hot-Encoding. This is a trick where we create new binary variables for our dataset. Each new variable represents one of the original options. \n","\n","Use the `sklearn` library to perform One-Hot-Encoding for the variable called `orientation`. Use `OneHotEncoder` from `sklearn` and set the parameter `handle_unknown='ignore'`. \n","\n","#### Hint No. 6\n","\n","It is standard procedure to perform feature scaling before training a model. This way, we can bring all the features to the same range and avoid having some features being more dominant than others.\n","\n","You can use the `MinMaxScaler` utility to set the data to pre-defined range between a minimum and a maximum number.
